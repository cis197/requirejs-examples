# Running the Example App

The example app should be ready to go. You'll need to have [`http-server`](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) installed. Once you have this, just run

```bash
http-server .
```

from the root directory and navigate to the URL that the command outputs (usually `http://localhost:8080`).
